# Appeal Policy — Lorem Ipsum

## Purpose

This document describes the process for appealing administrative or content decisions (the "Appeal Process") within the organization.

## Scope

Applies to decisions related to content removal, account actions, or other administrative determinations. Individual, team, and external stakeholder appeals are covered where explicitly permitted.

## Eligibility

- Appeals may be submitted by the party directly affected by the decision.
- Appeals must be filed within 30 calendar days of notice of the decision, unless otherwise stated.

## Submission Requirements

To file an appeal, submit:

1. A clear statement of the decision being appealed (include date, decision ID if available).
2. A concise explanation of why the decision should be reviewed.
3. Any supporting evidence or documentation.
4. Contact details for follow-up.

Submissions should be sent to the designated appeals inbox or via the web form linked in the notice.

## Review Process

- Receipt: Appeals are acknowledged within 5 business days.
- Initial assessment: A reviewer confirms eligibility and completeness within 10 business days.
- Full review: An independent reviewer or panel evaluates the appeal and any new evidence. This may include consultation with subject-matter experts.
- Decision timeline: A final determination is issued within 30 calendar days of appeal acceptance. If additional time is required, the appellant is notified with reasons and an estimated decision date.

## Possible Outcomes

- Decision reversed in full.
- Decision modified.
- Decision upheld.
- Remand for additional fact-finding.

Decisions include a written rationale and, where applicable, instructions for compliance or next steps.

## Confidentiality and Records

Appeals are treated as confidential. Records of appeals and dispositions are retained according to the organization’s record retention policy.

## Further Remedies

If available, additional escalation channels or external remedies will be described in the decision notice.

## Amendments

This policy may be updated; the current version and effective date are published on the internal policy site.
